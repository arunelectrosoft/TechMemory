1. Install Ruby
2. $sudo gem install jekyll
3. $sudo jekyll new website_name
4. $sudo jekyll serve

Above command will host the static site in local host http://127.0.0.1:4000

what is Jekyll ?
It is a static website ( website using plain html) generator.

What are the default folders ?

1. config.yml (yaml format - improved version of json)
2. _layouts folder can be created
3. _posts - contain the writing content or pages of the website.
4. _data can be used for overall variables used in site.
5. _sass is for the sass based css generator
6. assets and images are folders used to have extra content related resources

Next post , I will check out the frontmatter or _config file specific options,
I learned.
