Jekyll Front Matter is about the YAML configuration Files in every Post file.


The following variables are useful in jekyll posts

layout - decides how the layout of the post is displayed in the html file.
published - if set to false, the post will not be published.
permalink - decides the URL of the post. default is /year/month/day/title.html
tags - similar to categories.



Experiment is :

2. Try the collections - done
3. Try the categories
